## Overview
This project involves analyzing a Spotify dataset with various attributes about tracks, albums, and artists using **SQL**. It covers an end-to-end process of normalizing a denormalized dataset, performing SQL queries of varying complexity (easy, medium, and advanced), and optimizing query performance. The primary goals of the project are to practice advanced SQL skills and generate valuable insights from the dataset.

```sql
-- create table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS spotify;
CREATE TABLE spotify (
    artist VARCHAR(255),
    track VARCHAR(255),
    album VARCHAR(255),
    album_type VARCHAR(50),
    danceability FLOAT,
    energy FLOAT,
    loudness FLOAT,
    speechiness FLOAT,
    acousticness FLOAT,
    instrumentalness FLOAT,
    liveness FLOAT,
    valence FLOAT,
    tempo FLOAT,
    duration_min FLOAT,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    channel VARCHAR(255),
    views FLOAT,
    likes BIGINT,
    comments BIGINT,
    licensed BOOLEAN,
    official_video BOOLEAN,
    stream BIGINT,
    energy_liveness FLOAT,
    most_played_on VARCHAR(50)
);
```
## Project Steps

### 1. Data Exploration
Before diving into SQL, it’s important to understand the dataset thoroughly. The dataset contains attributes such as:
- `Artist`: The performer of the track.
- `Track`: The name of the song.
- `Album`: The album to which the track belongs.
- `Album_type`: The type of album (e.g., single or album).
- Various metrics such as `danceability`, `energy`, `loudness`, `tempo`, and more.

### 4. Querying the Data
After the data is inserted, various SQL queries can be written to explore and analyze the data. Queries are categorized into **easy**, **medium**, and **advanced** levels to help progressively develop SQL proficiency.

#### Easy Queries
- Simple data retrieval, filtering, and basic aggregations.
  
#### Medium Queries
- More complex queries involving grouping, aggregation functions, and joins.
  
#### Advanced Queries
- Nested subqueries, window functions, CTEs, and performance optimization.

### 5. Query Optimization
In advanced stages, the focus shifts to improving query performance. Some optimization strategies include:
- **Indexing**: Adding indexes on frequently queried columns.
- **Query Execution Plan**: Using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to review and refine query performance.

1. Retrieve the names of all tracks that have more than 1 billion streams.
```sql
select track from spotify where stream>1000000000
```
2. List all albums along with their respective artists.
```sql
select distinct album, artist from spotify order by 1
```

3. Get the total number of comments for tracks where `licensed = TRUE`.
```sql
select sum(comments) from spotify where licensed=true

```

4. Find all tracks that belong to the album type `single`.
```sql
select track from spotify where album_type='single'
```

5. Count the total number of tracks by each artist.
```sql
select 
	artist,
	count(*) as total_songs
from spotify group by artist
```



1. Calculate the average danceability of tracks in each album.
```sql
select * from spotify
select 
	   album,  ---1
       avg(danceability)  ---2
from spotify 
group by album
order by 2 desc
```
2. Find the top 5 tracks with the highest energy values.
```sql
select track,
		max(energy)
from spotify 
group by 1 
order by 2 
desc limit 5
```
3. List all tracks along with their views and likes where `official_video = TRUE`.
```sql
select track,sum(views) as total_views,sum(likes) as total_likes from spotify where official_video='true' group by 1
```
4. For each album, calculate the total views of all associated tracks.
```sql
select album,
	   track,
		sum(views)
from spotify
group by 1,2
```
5. Retrieve the track names that have been streamed on Spotify more than YouTube.
```sql
select * from
(select track,
	   -- most_played_on,
	   COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN most_played_on='Youtube' THEN stream END),0)
	   as most_streamed_youtube,
	   COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN most_played_on='Spotify' THEN stream END),0)
	   as most_streamed_spotify
from spotify
group by 1) as T1 where
most_streamed_spotify> most_streamed_youtube AND most_streamed_youtube <> 0
```

1. **Use a `WITH` clause to calculate the difference between the highest and lowest energy values for tracks in each album.**
```sql
WITH cte
AS
(SELECT 
	album,
	MAX(energy) as highest_energy,
	MIN(energy) as lowest_energery
FROM spotify
GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT 
	album,
	highest_energy - lowest_energery as energy_diff
FROM cte
ORDER BY 2 DESC
```

## Technology Stack
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **SQL Queries**: DDL, DML, Aggregations, Joins, Subqueries, Window Functions
- **Tools**: pgAdmin 4 (or any SQL editor), PostgreSQL (via Homebrew, Docker, or direct installation)

## How to Run the Project
1. Install PostgreSQL and pgAdmin (if not already installed).
2. Set up the database schema and tables using the provided normalization structure.
3. Insert the sample data into the respective tables.
4. Execute SQL queries to solve the listed problems.
5. Explore query optimization techniques for large datasets.

---

## Next Steps
- **Visualize the Data**: Use a data visualization tool like **Tableau** or **Power BI** to create dashboards based on the query results.
- **Expand Dataset**: Add more rows to the dataset for broader analysis and scalability testing.
- **Advanced Querying**: Dive deeper into query optimization and explore the performance of SQL queries on larger datasets.
